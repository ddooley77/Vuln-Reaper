# Vuln-Reaper

Final project for the Building AI course

## 1. Summary

Vuln-Reaper is a vulnerability prioritization tool that leverages AI to predict the exploitability of vulnerabilities, aiding security and development teams in making informed decisions. It correlates vulnerability data from multiple sources, identifies high-priority threats, and provides actionable insights for efficient remediation.

## 2. Background

* **Problem**: The sheer volume of vulnerabilities identified by various security tools can overwhelm security and development teams. Manual prioritization is time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to potential delays in addressing critical threats.
* **Frequency**: This problem is widespread across organizations of all sizes, as the complexity of modern software and the evolving threat landscape contribute to an ever-increasing number of vulnerabilities.
* **Motivation**: The need for a more efficient and intelligent approach to vulnerability management, enabling organizations to focus their resources on the most critical risks.
* **Importance**: Effective vulnerability prioritization is crucial for reducing the attack surface and minimizing the potential impact of cyberattacks.


## 3. Data and AI Techniques

* **Data Sources**: 
    * Static code/binary analysis tools
    * Composition analysis (software dependency scanning)
    * Infrastructure analysis tools
    * DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
    * Penetration testing reconnaissance
    * Exploit databases
    * Environmental information
    * Company asset details
* **AI Techniques**:
    * **Semi-supervised Learning:** To leverage labeled exploitability data and vast amounts of unlabeled vulnerability data.
    * **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** To process and understand vulnerability descriptions, exploit details, and environmental context.
    * **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** To model the relationships between vulnerabilities, assets, and exploits within a network.
    * **Ensemble Methods:** To combine predictions from different models and improve overall accuracy.

## 4. How it is used

* **Context**: Vuln-Reaper is primarily used within the security operations center (SOC) and by development teams. It integrates with existing vulnerability management workflows and provides actionable intelligence to prioritize remediation efforts.
* **Users**: 
    * Security Analysts: To identify and investigate high-priority vulnerabilities.
    * Developers: To understand the security implications of code changes and prioritize fixes.
    * Security Managers: To gain visibility into the overall security posture and make informed risk management decisions.
* **Impact**: By enabling efficient vulnerability prioritization, Vuln-Reaper helps organizations reduce their attack surface and minimize the risk of exploitation.

## 5. Challenges

* **Data Quality and Consistency:** Handling inconsistencies and variations in vulnerability data from different tools and sources.
* **False Positives and Negatives:** Minimizing misclassifications of vulnerabilities as exploitable or non-exploitable.
* **Evolving Threat Landscape:** Adapting to new attack techniques and emerging vulnerabilities.
* **Data Privacy and Security:** Ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive vulnerability data.

## 6. What next

Code !!  :-)

* **Enhanced Correlation**: Develop more sophisticated correlation algorithms to identify relationships between seemingly disparate vulnerabilities.
* **Predictive Modeling**: Incorporate threat intelligence and attack patterns to predict future exploitation trends.
* **Explainable AI**: Provide transparent explanations for vulnerability prioritization decisions, enhancing trust and understanding.
