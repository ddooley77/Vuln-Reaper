# Vuln-Reaper

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Vuln-Reaper is a vulnerability prioritization tool that leverages AI to predict the exploitability of vulnerabilities, aiding security and development teams in making informed decisions. It correlates vulnerability data from multiple sources, identifies high-priority threats, and provides actionable insights for efficient remediation.

## Background

* **Problem**: The sheer volume of vulnerabilities identified by various security tools can overwhelm security and development teams. Manual prioritization is time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to potential delays in addressing critical threats.
* **Frequency**: This problem is widespread across organizations of all sizes, as the complexity of modern software and the evolving threat landscape contribute to an ever-increasing number of vulnerabilities.
* **Motivation**: The need for a more efficient and intelligent approach to vulnerability management, enabling organizations to focus their resources on the most critical risks.
* **Importance**: Effective vulnerability prioritization is crucial for reducing the attack surface and minimizing the potential impact of cyberattacks.



## How is it used?

* Context: Vuln-Reaper is primarily used within the security operations center (SOC) and by development teams. It integrates with existing vulnerability management workflows and provides actionable intelligence to prioritize remediation efforts.
* Users:
   * Security Analysts: To identify and investigate high-priority vulnerabilities.
   * Developers: To understand the security implications of code changes and prioritize fixes.
   * Security Leaders: To gain visibility into the overall security posture and make informed risk management decisions.
* Impact: By enabling efficient vulnerability prioritization, Vuln-Reaper helps organizations reduce their attack surface and minimize the risk of exploitation.



## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

Data Quality and Consistency: Handling inconsistencies and variations in vulnerability data from different tools and sources.
False Positives and Negatives: Minimizing misclassifications of vulnerabilities as exploitable or non-exploitable.
Evolving Threat Landscape: Adapting to new attack techniques and emerging vulnerabilities.
Data Privacy and Security: Ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive vulnerability data.
